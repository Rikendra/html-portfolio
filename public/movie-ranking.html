<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
    <p>"Stranger Things" is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the early 1980s. The Hawkins National Laboratory nearby appears to conduct scientific research for the U.S. Department of Energy, but secretly conducts experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, including those involving human test subjects. Unintentionally, they have created a portal to an alternate dimension known as "the Upside Down." The influence of the Upside Down begins to affect the residents of Hawkins in unsettling ways.
        The first season begins in November 1983 when Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. Meanwhile, a young psychokinetic girl named Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) escapes from the laboratory and helps Will's friends, such as Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo), and Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), in their own efforts to find Will.
        The second season is set a year later, starting in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but few know the details of his ordeal. When it's discovered that Will is still influenced by the negative aspects of the Upside Down, his friends and family realize there's a greater threat to their universe stemming from the Upside Down.
        The third season is set several months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July in 1985. The new "Starcourt" shopping mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins residents, causing many other stores to close down. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship while trying to care for Joyce. Unbeknownst to the town, a secret Soviet laboratory beneath Starcourt attempts to open a gateway to the Upside Down, allowing entities from that dimension to possess people in Hawkins, creating new horrors to confront.
        The fourth season is set several months later, in March 1986. Joyce, Will, Eleven, and Jonathan have moved to Lenora, California, to start anew. In California, Eleven struggles with the loss of her powers and faces bullying at school. Meanwhile, in Hawkins, creatures from the Upside Down, later dubbed Vecna, begin killing Hawkins residents, opening a new gateway between two worlds in the process. Dr. Sam Owens and Dr. Martin Brenner plan to stop Vecna and bring Eleven to a facility to help her regain her powers. Meanwhile, Joyce and Murray fly to Russia to rescue Hopper from a Gulag in Kamchatka.</p>
